			<p>Our journey started in 1990 as a small family firm named M/s Active Engineers. The current Chairman &amp; Managing Director of MAEIPL Mr. Sunil Vidolkar, worked as a Testing &amp; Commissioning Engineer for the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Corporation Limited (MSEDCL) from 1980 to 1990, during which time he gained significant expertise not only in testing and commissioning, but across all major domains of power transmission &amp; distribution systems. Having been able to foresee the immense potential for growth in India’s power sector Mr. Vidolkar decided to start out on his own.</p>
<p>Active Engineers had humble beginnings with a 11 kv capacitor installation project for M/S Asea Brown Boveri Pvt. Ltd. The project won wide scale appreciation, and needless to say, may more projects followed. And with each completed project came more success, and a greater reputation of a company that could deliver high quality work well within stipulated time. The result- a growing clientele base and business which eventually took Active Engineers to a major milestone on 3rd July 2006, when the company was granted Pvt. Ltd. status. Active Engineers was henceforth called Maha Active Engineers India Pvt. Ltd. MAEIPL has since lived upto and further enhanced its reputation as the state’s leading provider of world class power T&amp;D infrastructure.</p>
<p>The evolution of MAEIPL has been in success story in itself, but evolution, by definition, is never over. Today MAEIPL has extended its services in the field of renewable energy, and with the constantly increasing and modifying demands of the future, MAEIPL promises to add many more feathers to its wing.</p>
